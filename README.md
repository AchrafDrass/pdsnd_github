### Project Title
bikeshare

### Description
In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
python.py
chicago.csv
washington.csv
new_york_city.csv

### Credits
the project is made with the help of the knowledge from the programming for data science with python course on Udacity
